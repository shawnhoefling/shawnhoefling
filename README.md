# About Me
> I am currently a third-year Computer Science student with hopes to complete my studies at Oulu University, working to finish my bachelor's and possibly pushing through to my master's as well.
> I am from the United States, I have been living in New York City for over half a decade, but I have a background in the Coast Guard so I am very used to adapating to new places. I moved to Finland during an exchange program, I extended the program and now hope to transfer over full time. I have built the foundations of a life in Finland and the harmony between nature and civilization has always been imporatnt to me. 
> Up until now I have taken the usual courses you see in most comprehensive Computer Science courses. Courses like C programming, Discrete Mathematics, and Data Structures and Algorithms, but I have been sure to take many courses wherever I feel a gap in my knowledge.
> As of now, I am working on Android mobile development, using Android Studio to develop applications in XML, Java, and Kotlin.
> I have taken a few Finnish courses at Aalto University and I am working daily to improve.
>
>  - I would love to work for a Finnish based technology company, preferably in Helsinki or Oulu, but I am not very picky!

## Interest
> I am interested in developing anything from mobile applications and websites to working on embedded systems and more closely with companies for using software as a solution to a problem. I love being outdoors and in harsh and otherwise interesting environments, so working on a weather system that I develop and maintain programmatically and physically would be perfect. I am not driven by money, but through passion in what I do, the people I work with, and what I am working on.

## Contact Me
> If you would like to contact me, I am easy to reach and will usually respond within 24 hours!
